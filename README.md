# TFTool
A rest-based Java API, TFTool compiles match history data and outputs stats on units, traits, summoners on the NA server. Currently only supports data on Set 4 Fates (Festival of Beasts was just released). This is a functioning prototype and is not indicative of the final product.

# Planned Updates
* Will support data from Sets 1-3.5 and 4.5
* Analysis of most popular units and compositions in every tier
* SQL Database
